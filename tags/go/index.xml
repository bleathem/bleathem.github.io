      <description>It seems like just yesterday that I found myself awestruck with awestruct, and yet here I am today reviving my blog with a new site building tool called Hugo. The motivation for this was two-fold.
  My awestruct/Asciidoctor gem configuration had fallen out of date, and needed some TLC to get working again.
  I wanted to learn Go.
   While I&amp;#8217;ve successfully migrated my blog/site to hugo, I have not managed to realize goal 2 and learn about Go in the process!</description>
