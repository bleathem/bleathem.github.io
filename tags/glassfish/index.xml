      <description>Call me eager, call me insane, I had a JavaEE 6 app up and running in production on Glassfish 3.0 one month after it&amp;rsquo;s release. The improvements in JSF 2 and CDI were too compelling for me to hold off adopting, and sure enough, the application was quick and painless to develop.
I did however pay a price for being an early adopter - a Glassfish / Weld bug was preventing my JSF login pages from working.</description>
