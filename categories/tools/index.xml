      <description>It seems like just yesterday that I found myself awestruck with awestruct, and yet here I am today reviving my blog with a new site building tool called Hugo. The motivation for this was two-fold.
  My awestruct/Asciidoctor gem configuration had fallen out of date, and needed some TLC to get working again.
  I wanted to learn Go.
   While I&amp;#8217;ve successfully migrated my blog/site to hugo, I have not managed to realize goal 2 and learn about Go in the process!</description>

      <title>From svn to mercurial, the hg rises!</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of moving from svn to a distributed version control system (dvcs) for a long time. I held back, hoping the mercurial (hg) vs. git &amp;ldquo;war&amp;rdquo; would declare a winner, but as major projects started adopting the two dvcs&amp;rsquo;s, it became apparent to me that neither tool was going to disappear anytime soon. This notion was cemented for me when I read a forum post saying hg = git &amp;gt;&amp;gt; svnThat settled it.</description>
